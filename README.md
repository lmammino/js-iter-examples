## Prerequisites

Make sure to have a recent version of Node.js installed.

All the examples should work with Node.js 16 (but they have been tested with Node.js 20).


## Install

Simply clone the repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.


## Create some sample logs

To create a small sample log file, you can run:

```bash
node src/generate-log-file > logs.jsonl
```

To create a much bigger sample log file, you can run:

```bash
node src/generate-log-file 20000000 > logs-big.jsonl
```

Keep in mind that this operation might take a few minutes and that it will generate a big file (~3.6 GB).

## Run the log processor scripts

Now you can run the different implementations of the log processor scripts:

### [`process-eager.js`](./src/process-eager.js)

This is the first implementation (eager).

You can run it with:

```bash
node src/process-eager.js logs.jsonl
```

But if you try to run it with the bigger log file:

```bash
node src/process-eager.js logs-big.jsonl
```

You should see an error!


### [`process-iter.js`](./src/process-iter.js)

This is the optimised version, using async iterators.

You can run it with:

```bash
node src/process-iter.js logs.jsonl
```

And it will also be able to process the bigger log file:

```bash
node src/process-iter.js logs-big.jsonl
```

... which might take a couple of minutes, depending on your device power.


### [`process-iter-helpers.js`](./src/process-iter-helpers.js)

This is a version of the previous script using `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` through [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/).

Check it out and compare the code with the previous implementation.
